This repository demonstrates a common error in R when subsetting data frames using character vectors for column names. The `bug.R` file shows the original code that fails when a specified column does not exist in the data frame. The `bugSolution.R` file offers several ways to handle this issue gracefully, preventing errors and ensuring that your code runs smoothly even with potentially missing column names.
